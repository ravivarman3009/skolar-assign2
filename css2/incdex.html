            <p>
             
                    The peacock is the most exquisite bird in the world <br>because of its vibrant feathers and colour<br>
                The peacock is the national bird of India and national<br> pride for all of its citizens.<br>
                Peacocks mainly thrive by eating plants and small animals<br>  and are one of the largest birds in the country.<br>
                Peacocks are ground-feeders that eat insects, plants, and <br>small creatures. <br>There are two familiar peacock species. <br>The blue peacock lives in India and Sri Lanka, while the green <br>peacock is found in Java and Myanmar (Burma). <br>A more distinct and little-known species, the Congo peacock,<br> inhabits African rain forests.
